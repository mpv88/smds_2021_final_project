Period from [1st October 2020 to 1st February 2021] and prepare the following points:
1)Perform some explanatory analysis for your data, especially by use of graphical tools.
2)Describe the quality of the data and discuss whether and how a plausible statistical model could be posed.
3)Build a model for your response variable Y. To this aim you can adopt any among the regression techniques covered during the course. Comment the estimates from the best model obtained.
4)By building your model, evaluate inclusion of some covariates and their effect on the response variable. Possible covariates are: regional colors (yellow, orange, red), partial lockdown regime, region-specific laws & rules, etc.
5)Check the model fit by using the proper tools, such as residuals plots.
6)Provide 10-15 days-forward predictions and check their accuracy (say, for the period February 2nd to February 15, 2021).
7)Compare alternative models in terms of predictive information criteria and comment.

#TODO:
fix validation for LOOCV 
find offset for GLMs in tidy does exist?

#MAIN_TAKEAWAYS:
# use Ctrl+Alt+R to write ordered code in sections DONE
# use stopifnot on each function beginning NOT TODO
# use models <- purrr::map(by_country$data, country_lm) to apply model multiple time at once NOT TODO 
# use "DataExplorer" for quick EDA (and then create ad-hoc graphs for more detailed features) DONE
# use pipes for all data wrangling DONE
# use "caret" for all model LM, GLM, GAM, Bayes (#TOSELF: learn tidymodels) DOING
# perform stepwise selection on LM (broom::glance(mod1) to evaluate different models) TODO
# use ANOVA with CHI/F test to evaluate nested models DONE
# estimate validation error DONE
# evaluate Mean squared error (MSE), Root mean squared error (RMSE), Mean absolute error (MAE) on OOS for all models DONE
