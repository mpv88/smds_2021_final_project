# smds_2021_final_project: model Veneto region covid-19 cases 
Discovering which may be some suitable factors/covariates able to better explain the spreading of Covid-19 disease and consequently base our tentative predictions on them.
Evaluate the goodness of fit of proposed models with reference to official data and compare the accuracy of our projections to real-world evidences, on a predefined period of time.

## Aims: 
### a) model the intensive care units (ICU) during the period from 01/10/2020 to 01/02/2021.
### b) predict 10-15 days-forward ICUs, and check forecasts' accuracy vs true data (02/02/2021 to 15/02/2021).
